# Email-Spam-Classification-Using-NLP

Abstract:

Due to its cost-effectiveness, email has become the primary method of commercial and general communication. These emails can be accessed by everyone quickly with an internet connection. For these reasons, despite the existence of other communication tools, the usage of email keeps growing. The rapid increase in technology has caused many applications to be automated. Considering this example: Email spamming increased as a result of the automation of emails. This has become a significant problem for email communication. 

Before artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, various solutions included manual detection by identifying the specific keywords in the email but this method is not possible to solve the current problem. Since the number of emails generated nowadays is vast, then the picture of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms comes into focus. E

mails can be classified into various categories very easily based on the requirements of a particular user or a company. This email spam classification model is implemented by using Python & classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
